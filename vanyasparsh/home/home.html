      <h2 class="section-title text-center">Deforestation</h2>

      <div class="paragraph pt-3 section-subtitle" style="text-align: justify;">
        Deforestation probably originated with the use of fire, and estimates are that
        40-50% of the Earth's original forest area has been lost. Some of that loss happened before settled agriculture
        began, approximately 10,000 years ago, but only in recent decades is there reliable information on rates of
        deforestation.Deforestation has had many adverse effects on the planet. Significant effects of deforestation are
        climate change, soil erosion, global warming, wildlife extinction and underground water depletion. Besides,
        there are other consequences such as flooding, shrinking wildlife habitats, and reduced water quality.
        Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. Throughout history and into modern times, forests
        have been razed to make space for agriculture and animal grazing, and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing,
        and construction.Deforestation is cutting down a large number of trees and clearing out forest areas. The
        various reasons behind these human activities are increasing the space for human usage like logging or wood
        extraction, agricultural expansion, infrastructure expansion etc. Deforestation is defined as the conversion of
        forest to other land uses (regardless of whether it is human-induced). Deforestation and forest area net change
        are not the same: the latter is the sum of all forest losses (deforestation) and all forest gains (forest
        expansion) in a given period.

    <h2 class="sub-heading">How Carbon is Calculated?</h2>
    Calculating a carbon footprint involves assessing the greenhouse gas emissions produced directly and indirectly by
    various activities, products, or processes. Here's a general overview of how the carbon footprint calculation
    works:
    <div class="carbonCalculation">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color:#013A20">Identify Activities</h3>
          First, you identify the activities or processes for which you want to calculate the carbon footprint. These
          activities can range from personal behaviors like transportation and energy usage to industrial processes or
          the production of goods and services.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color:#013A20">Data Collection</h3>
          Gather data on the inputs and outputs associated with each activity. This may include factors such as energy
          consumption, fuel usage, transportation distances, waste generation, and material production.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color:#013A20">Emission Factors</h3>
          For each type of input (e.g., electricity consumption, fuel usage), you need emission factors. Emission
          factors represent the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced per unit of input. These factors can vary
          based on the type of energy source, fuel, or material used.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color:#013A20">Calculations</h3>
          Multiply the quantity of each input by its corresponding emission factor to determine the emissions associated
          with that input. This yields the emissions attributable to each activity or process.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color:#013A20">Aggregation</h3>
          Sum up the emissions from all activities to obtain the total carbon footprint. This provides an overall
          estimate of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with a particular entity, such as an individual,
          organization, product, or event.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color:#013A20">Conversion</h3>
          Express the total emissions in a standardized unit, typically carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). This accounts
          for the varying potency of different greenhouse gases in contributing to climate change.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <h3 style="color:#013A20">Reporting and Analysis</h3>
          Present the results in a clear and understandable format, such as kilograms or metric tons of CO2e per unit of
          time (e.g., annually). Analyze the data to identify key sources of emissions and opportunities for reduction.
        </li><br>

      </ol>
    </div>
    By calculating and understanding their carbon footprint, individuals, businesses, and policymakers can make
    informed decisions to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. This process helps raise awareness, set
    targets for emission reduction, and track progress toward sustainability goals. Additionally, it enables
    stakeholders to identify areas where improvements can be made to minimize environmental impact.
