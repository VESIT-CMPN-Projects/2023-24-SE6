Deforestation and climate change are pressing environmental issues with interconnected
implications for ecosystems and societies worldwide. Forests play a crucial role as carbon sinks,
absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) through photosynthesis and helping to stabilize the Earth's
climate. As forests are cleared, their ability to sequester carbon diminishes, leading to increased
CO2 emissions. This contributes to climate change, exacerbating weather patterns, biodiversity
loss, and the vulnerability of communities to natural disasters. Understanding the root causes and
consequences of deforestation on climate change is crucial for addressing these challenges and
preserving the health of our planet.
The idea is to create a user – friendly and educational website named “VanyaSparsh” which will
provide a better platform for the understanding of deforestation and measures that can contribute
for the betterment in the same regard as well as climate changes with the help of the various
interactive ideas and technology.
The user’s choices to just gain knowledge or contribute for the betterment of the cause, etc. will
be taken into consideration while making the website.
Remembering to prioritize user experience, accessibility, and up-to-date information to make
your deforestation website an effective tool for educating and mobilizing people to combat
deforestation.
